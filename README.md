## CMIP7 Data Request Software

This repo is used for active development of the CMIP7 data request python software.
A primary goal is to develop code that will allow modellers to smoothly integrate the data request into their workflows.

Some guidelines:

- Development is collaborative among data request task team members.
- Initial codes by individual contributors can be placed in a subdirectory of `sandbox` named by the contributor's initials.
- Please open an issue in this repo to identify bugs or required functionality

Content of the data request is managed separately from the software, [in this repo](https://github.com/CMIP-Data-Request/CMIP7_DReq_Content).
