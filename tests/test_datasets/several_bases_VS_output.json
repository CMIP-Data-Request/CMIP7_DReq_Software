As climate change accelerates, these extreme conditions are becoming more frequent and severe, posing significant risks to marine ecosystems and coastal communities. This opportunity will collect the high-frequency multidisciplinary approach to analyze these phenomena, their causes, and their effects, ultimately contributing to better management strategies and mitigation efforts. \u00a0Extreme sea levels are primarily caused by storm surges often in combination with astronomical tides, waves and/or river overflow, which requires climate-scale forcing data at the appropriate spatial and temporal scales to be combined with other resources offline. This opportunity is particularly relevant to revealing differences between eddy-permitting and coarse-resolution models.\n\nLong-term assessment of ocean extremes important for identifying vulnerable regions, designing coastal protection to appropriate levels, and assessing infrastructure and ecosystem viability. It also enables various adaptation measures to be considered and tested via sensitivity testing.

Also wind driven surface gravity waves affects several marine and atmosphere processes like: marine aerosols formations ( Dziembor, 2018), modulation of the air-sea fluxes (Qi et al. , 2024; Wu et al. 2022),  tropical cyclones maintenance and decay ( Zhang, et al. 2023), ocean mixing layer depths (Kantha & Clayson, 2004), planetary boundary layer profile and stability (Wu,  2022), among others processes. \nEstimating the role of the ocean's surface waves in the sea-level rise is under discussion ( Aucan et al., 2019) .\nSea-ice also might be affected by ocean waves as well (Alberello et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024), due to ice and waves interactions, such as wave induced fracturing, lateral and bottom melting (Yang et al., 2024), air-sea-ocean fluxes exchange. \n\nGeneral wave parameters (i.e. Significant Wave Height (SWH), Mean Period (MP), Peak Period (PP), mean direction (MD), peak direction (PD)) among partitioned parameters (same but for windsea and swells) are important to better represent all processes listed above. \nIt is nice to mention that the ocean surface wave community has joint efforts to create the COWCLIP (Coordinated Ocean Wave Climate Project).

The observational counterparts of these new liquid water path (LWP) and droplet effective radius (r\\_eff) joint histograms of cloud fraction have been used to estimate global aerosol indirect effects from observations in [Wall et al. (2023)](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/23/13125/2023/). Our new method utilizes monthly output of these new MODIS joint histograms and a decomposition technique from [Zelinka et al. (2013)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/26/14/jcli-d-12-00555.1.xml) to separately quantify the Twomey effect, liquid-water path (LWP) adjustment, and cloud-fraction (CF) adjustment for liquid-topped clouds in climate models. The paper highlighting the first use case of this method in GCMs is in preparation and should be submitted soon and will provide a framework for performing this decomposition. Due to its reliance on only monthly output from a pair of deck and fast track simulations (piClim-control and piClim-aer), and its ability to separately decompose SW ERFaci into its three separate components, we believe that inclusion of these new diagnostics in the CMIP7 plan would strongly support our understanding of SW ERFaci in GCMs. These new MODIS diagnostics can also be used in other studies of cloud feedbacks, such as Wall et al. (in prep), who have implemented the new histograms in five CMIP6-era GCMs to quantify the strength of cloud scattering and emissivity feedbacks from cloud-phase conversions.\n",

It is the depth at which density is larger than the density of the first model level+ a threshold of 0.03 kg.m-3 (appendix H24). We propose to make the reference depth 10 m instead of the first model level (note than some modelling groups already did it that way for CMIP6). A recent study based on OMIP (Treguier et al. 2023, <https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-16-3849-2023> )discusses the fact that using the first model level as a reference makes mlotst less comparable with obs (obs-based datasets reference the MLD to 10m because the diurnal cycle is not well-sampled by observations). Furthermore, the difference of the depth of the first model level between different models makes a significant difference in the computed MLDs in some seasons/regions (Treguier et al., 2023).\n",

Comparing models between each other or with observations becomes useless, because based on the method sfcWind is obtained, there can be up to 25% difference. \n\nAdditionally, it is unclear how sfcWindmax is obtained, is it instantaneous? Is it for the model time step? Since CMIP6 docs are down, I had to track the modelling centers to ask this questions and everyone has a different opinions even within one center.

These were listed in the \"Structure\" record. Ofx.basin is the only CMIP6 variable that uses these CF terms. As the structure record is not being used to define variables in CMIP7, we need to move the information somewhere else. This potentially means adding one or two columns in one of the Air TAble tables. \n\n1. Add \"Flag Values\" and \"Flag Meanings\" columns in the \"Physical Parameter\" table. These columns would be blank for all other variables, but it is easy to implement.  \n2. It may be clearer to use the \"Units\" table, and rename it \"Units and Flags\". The examples given for flag\\_values and flag\\_meanings in the CF Conventions document to not include a \"units\" value because there is no unit of measure here: each value in the Ofx.basin field is just a flag to be associated with a character value. This means that the value of \"units\" is redundant for this variable. Placing the flag\\_values and the flag\\_meanings in the \"Units and Flags\" table will make it easier to attach a clear explanation of this feature. This will not impact on how the information is exported to MIP Tables.

I suppose more models use TEOS10 now; should something be added in the variable description do indicate that practical salinity and not absolute salinity should be published in ESGF?
